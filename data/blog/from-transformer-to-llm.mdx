The transformer is a neural network with a specific structure that includes a mechanism called **self-attention** or more specifically, **multi-head attention**. This allows the model to build rich contextual representations of a token’s meaning by attending to and integrating information from surrounding tokens, effectively capturing how tokens relate to each other over long spans.

# I. The Transformer

## 1. Attention

### 1.1. Self-attention

Attention is a mechanism used in transformers to help a model focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when creating representations for each token. Instead of processing each token independently, attention allows the model to weigh and combine information from other tokens in the sequence. This process helps the model capture relationships between tokens and build better context-aware representations.

In a transformer, attention works by taking the representation of a token at layer $k-1$ and computing how much each of the other tokens should contribute to the token’s new representation at layer $k$. This is done by calculating attention scores, which reflect the relevance of each token to the one being processed.

Self-attention is a type of attention mechanism where each token in the sequence attends to (or "pays attention to") every other token, including itself. This allows the model to capture dependencies between tokens, regardless of their position in the sequence.

In self-attention, each token in the sequence is represented by three different types of vectors that capture distinct roles during the attention process. These roles are query, key, and value, and each token plays one of these roles at any given time.

To compute self-attention, transformers introduce three sets of weight matrices: $W^Q$, $W^K$, and $W^V$. These weight matrices are used to transform the input token representation $g_i$ into the query, key, and value vectors.

- Query vector $g_t$ is used to compute the attention scores with other tokens to determine which ones are most relevant to the current token.
  $$
  q_i=W^Q \cdot g_i
  $$
- The key vector $g_c$ helps to measure the similarity between tokens, allowing the model to decide how much attention to give each token based on the query-key comparison.
  $$
  k_i=W^K \cdot g_i
  $$
- The value vector $g_i$ contains the information (or "value") that will be aggregated and passed to the next layer
  $$
  v_i= V \cdot g_i
  $$

The self-attention mechanism computes attention scores by comparing the query vector of the current token with the key vectors of the previous tokens, then using these scores to weight the value vectors of those tokens. The weighted sum of the value vectors becomes the output for the current token.

To calculate the attention scores $\alpha$, which determine how much focus one token should have on another, we first compute the dot product between the query vector $q_t$ of the current token $t$ and the key vector $k_c$ of the other token $c$:

$$
\alpha_{t,c} = \text{softmax}\left(q_t \cdot k_c\right)
$$

However, the raw dot product can result in large values, especially as the model dimensionality increases, which could lead to gradient instability during training. To mitigate this, we scale the dot product by the square root of the dimensionality of the key vectors, $d_k$, which helps maintain stable gradients:

$$
\alpha_{t,c} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{q_t \cdot k_c}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)
$$

After computing the attention scores, we use them to weight the value vectors $v_i$ of all tokens. The final output for a token $t$, denoted as $h_t$, is the weighted sum of the value vectors, where the weights are the attention scores:

$$
h_t = \sigma \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \text{softmax}\left( \frac{\mathbf{q}_t \cdot \mathbf{k}_i}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) \cdot \mathbf{v}_i \right)
$$

This output, $h_t$, represents the context-aware embedding of token $t$, combining information from other tokens in the sequence, weighted by how relevant each token is to $t$.

### 1.2. Multi-head attention

Multi-head attention is a mechanism within transformers that extends self-attention by allowing the model to attend to different aspects of the input simultaneously. This is achieved by using multiple attention heads, each operating independently but in parallel.

- One for syntactic relatedness
- One for semantic relatedness
- One for coreference, etc

In multi-head attention, the attention mechanism is applied multiple times in parallel, with each attention "head" using its own set of learned parameters. Each head independently computes attention using its own query, key, and value matrices:

- Query vector: $q_i^h=W^{Q,h} \cdot g_i$
- Key vector: $k_i^h=W^{K,h}\cdot g_i$
- Value vector: $v_i^h= V^h \cdot g_i$

For each head $h$, the attention scores are computed as:

$$
\text{head}_t^h = \sum_{i=1}^n \text{softmax} \left( \frac{\mathbf{q}_t^h \cdot \mathbf{k}_i^h}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) \cdot \mathbf{v}_i^h
$$

Concatenate all head vectors and project then

$$
h_t = \left( \text{head}_t^1 \oplus \cdots \oplus \text{head}_t^m \right) \cdot W^O
$$

## 2. Position embeddings

Self-attention mechanisms in transformers do not inherently capture the order of words in a sequence. This lack of positional information can be problematic because the meaning of a sentence often depends on the order of its words.

To address this, transformers use position embeddings to encode the position of each token in the sequence. These embeddings are then added to the token embeddings, allowing the model to incorporate both the semantic meaning of the words and their positions in the sequence.

**Simple solution:** Concatenate the semantic word embedding with an absolute position embedding. This combined embedding is then used as the input to the transformer model, enabling it to understand the order of words in addition to their meanings.

Multi-head self-attention isn’t quite sufficient. We need a few extra things and package everything up into so-called Transformer blocks.

## 3. Types of Transformer models

### 4.1. Sequence Encoders with self-attention

Encoder self-attention covers the entire sequence, i.e. both the words to the left of the current position and the words to the right of the current position.

- Text classification (one label per sentence)
  - Train a model on the MLM task, adding a `[CLS]` token in front of every sentence
  - Throw away the output layer, create a new one
  - Fine-tune the model to predict the label at the `[CLS]` position

- Sequence labeling
  - Train a model on the MLM task
  - Throw away the output layer, create a new one
  - Fine-tune the model on POS-annotated data

### 4.2. Sequence Decoders with self-attention

- Attention can only access tokens to the left.
- But typically, far-way tokens get less attention.
- Decoder self-attention only covers the words to the left of the current position (because the words to the right are not yet known at test time).

### 4.3. Encoder-Decoder model with cross-attention (Machine Translation)

- **Train an Encoder for the Source Language:** The encoder processes the input sequence in the source language and generates a set of context-aware representations for each token.
- **Train a Decoder for the Target Language:** The decoder generates the output sequence in the target language, using the context provided by the encoder.
- **Connecting Encoder and Decoder:**
  - **First Idea:** Directly connecting the encoder and decoder can work if the source and target languages have the same word order.
  - **Cross-Attention:** To handle different word orders and improve translation quality, we use cross-attention. Cross-attention allows the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the source sequence by attending to the encoder's output representations.

# II. Large Language Models (LLMs)

## 1. Definition

LLMs are advanced **machine learning models** designed to **predict the next word** in a text sequence. These models leverage deep neural networks based on the Transformer architecture and contain billions of parameters. They are trained on vast amounts of text data collected from the web.

- **Key Mechanism**: Self-Attention
- **Input**: A sequence of tokens.
- **Output**: Probabilities for the next token.

Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in the sequence, enabling it to capture contextual relationships and dependencies between words, regardless of their distance from each other in the text.

## 2. Training Process

- The LLM is trained through **self-supervision**:
  1. Given a text made of tokens $[w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n]$, we take partial sequences $[w_1, w_2, \dots, w_i]$ and seek to predict the next token $w_{i+1}$.
  2. The LLM will take as input $[w_1, w_2, \dots, w_i]$ and output a **probability distribution** $\hat{y}_i$ over possible next tokens.
  3. The loss for this token is then defined as the cross-entropy:

     $$
     L_{CE} = -\log \hat{y}_i[w_{i+1}]
     $$
     - **Explanation:** Probability of the actual token $w_{i+1}$ in the output distribution $\hat{y}_i$.

  4. We then make (at batch level) a small update on the model weights $\theta$ to reduce the loss.

- **Basic model update** through stochastic gradient descent (SGD):

  $$
  \theta^{t+1} = \theta^t - \eta \nabla_\theta L_{CE}
  $$
  - **Explanation:**
    - $\theta^t$: Current model weights.
    - $\nabla_\theta L_{CE}$: Gradient of the cross-entropy loss as a function of the model weights.
    - $\eta$: Learning rate (controls the step size of each update).

- **LLM training relies on optimizers** that are variants of SGD:
  - Such as Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation).
  - **Distributed training** setup using many GPUs.

## 3. Types of LLMs

- Encoder-only
  - **Masked language modeling**: These models predict missing words in a sentence.
  - **Smaller & older models**: Despite being less complex, they are still effective for information extraction (IE) tasks.
- Decoder-only:
  - **Dominant approach to LLMs**: These models generate text by predicting the next word in a sequence.
- Encoder-decoder
  - **Self-attention and cross-attention**: These models use both mechanisms to process input and output sequences.
  - **Employed for tasks such as machine translation (MT)**: They are effective for tasks that require understanding and generating text in different languages.

## 4. Model Alignment

### 4.1. Fine-tuning

Once a model has been pre-trained, it can be fine-tuned for a specific task. Fine-tuning involves additional training with smaller amounts of in-domain data, using the pre-trained model as a starting point. This process is much more data-efficient than training a model from scratch because the pre-trained model has already learned useful semantic representations that can be transferred to the new task.

During fine-tuning, only a small fraction of the parameters are optimized, a technique known as **Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT)**. PEFT techniques include:

- **Adapters:** These are small trainable modules inserted between layers of the pre-trained model. Adapters allow the model to learn task-specific adjustments without modifying the original model parameters extensively.
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** This technique modifies the model weights using low-rank matrices. By decomposing the weight updates into low-rank matrices, LoRA reduces the number of parameters that need to be trained, making the fine-tuning process more efficient.
- **Soft Prompting:** In this approach, trainable vectors are appended to the input prompt. These vectors are optimized during fine-tuning to guide the model's responses towards the desired task-specific outputs.
- **IA3 (Intrinsic Attention-guided Adaptation):** This method adjusts the attention mechanism in transformer layers. By fine-tuning the attention weights, IA3 allows the model to focus on task-relevant parts of the input sequence, improving performance on the specific task.

These PEFT techniques enable efficient adaptation of large pre-trained models to new tasks with minimal computational resources and data requirements.

### 4.2. Two Alignment Strategies

- **Instruction Tuning:** This involves training the model to follow specific instructions by providing it with pairs of instructions and correct responses.
  - Manually: Humans write questions or problems and their correct answers.
  - Dataset Conversion: Existing datasets for supervised NLP tasks (e.g., text classification, sentiment analysis, NER, machine translation) are converted into instruction-response pairs.
  - LLM Generation: Large language models generate instruction-response pairs based on external databases and general guidelines.

- **Preference Alignment:** This involves aligning the model's responses with human preferences using preference data, such as ratings of answers to prompts.
  - Common Format: Triples of the form `<prompt, chosen response, reject response>`.
  - Data Collection: Ratings can be collected by paying crowdworkers (following guidelines on what constitutes a “good” response) or by asking users to rate the responses they receive.

## 5. Prompting

A **prompt** = **input** to the LLM, which can be a question or instructions on the task to perform.

- System prompt: Generic instructions, defined by the system provider, on how the system should respond (be helpful, avoid offensive language, etc.) and how it should present itself to the user (“You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI…”)
- User prompt: Specific instructions provided by the user.

![prompting](/static/images/resource/from-transformer-to-llm/prompting_viz_10.png)

### 5.1. In-context Learning

**In-context learning**, also known as **few-shot prompting**, involves providing the model with a few examples or demonstrations within the prompt to help it understand the desired output for a given task. This technique is particularly useful for complex tasks where the model might need additional context to generate accurate and relevant responses.

By including examples in the prompt, the model can learn from these instances and apply the learned patterns to produce the expected output.

### 5.2. Chain-of-Thought

But those “reasoning” capabilities can be improved by forcing the LLM to generate longer, step-by-step responses

- “Let’s think step by step”
- In-context demonstrations of reasoning steps involved in solving similar problems
- Can also ask the model to criticize or debate its own responses

## 6. Generation

Assume we have a trained a generative LLM that takes as input a list of $[w_1, w_2, …, w_n]$ and return a probability distribution over the next token $w_{i+1}$

### 6.1. Greedy Decoding

- At each step, just select the token with highest probability
- And continue until a special `<eos>` token, or the maximum output length

But greedy decoding is **short-sighted** ↔ Can get trapped in local minima (good “local” choice of token, but poor text at the end, with no way to backtrack)

### 6.2 Beam search decoding

- We keep at each step a "beam" of K hypotheses representing the best partial outputs so far
- Those K hypotheses are gradually expanded, token by token
- Until we reach `<eos>` or the maximum output length
- Finally, we take the hypothesis with max probability among the K alternatives

### 6.3. Top-K sampling

- At each step, we select the K tokens with highest probability
- We sample the next token only among those `K` possibilities (after renormalising the distribution)
- And continue until `<eo>` or max sentence length

### 6.4. Top-p sampling

- Same principle, but instead of a fixed K, we select tokens among those making up the top **`p%`** of the probability mass

### 6.5. Temperature

The `creativity` of the generation can be controlled by the temperature

- Temperatures < 1 will make the decoder more “conservative”, increasing its focus on high-probability tokens
- Temperatures > 1 will make the decoder more “creative” and sometimes select less-likely tokens

## 7. Retrieval-augmented generation

**Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** is a method to enhance LLMs by connecting them to external databases or specialized knowledge sources.

### 7.1. Shortcomings of LLMs

- **Static Knowledge**: Cannot add, remove, or update factual knowledge without retraining the model.
- **Lack of Transparency**: Difficult to inspect the model's knowledge or determine which source in the training data influenced the model's answers.

### 7.2. Basic Idea

1. **Retriever**: Given a user prompt, search for relevant documents in a text database (Information Retrieval Task).
2. **Reader**: Retrieve the most relevant texts and add them to the prompt to generate the response.

### 7.3. Advantages of RAG

- Easier to **edit** the LLM’s factual knowledge: simply update the underlying database, without needing to retrain the LLM!
- Cleaner distinction between "linguistic" and "factual" knowledge
- Better **transparency**: if a model produces a wrong answer, we can check whether the error stems from the retrieved documents
- Better **attribution**: the LLM can indicate the sources that have been used to generate its response
