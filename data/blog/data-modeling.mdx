summary: 'This article explores the importance of Data Modeling as a foundational blueprint for organizing information within a business, aiding in the development of a data warehouse. It emphasizes the role of a Logical Data Model (LDM) in establishing frameworks for business intelligence and analytics, ensuring data consistency, quality, and effective communication. The article also contrasts Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) models and summarizes the transition from a Logical to a Physical Data Model (PDM) for enhanced database performance.'

## Data Modeling

**Data modeling** is the **process** of creating a conceptual representation of data and its relationships, which helps us understand how data is stored, accessed, updated, and queried within the database. The **output of that process** is a formal description of the data that has been modeled, which is called a data model. A data model can be compared to a roadmap, an architect's blueprint, or any formal diagram that facilitates a deeper understanding of what is being designed **[IBM Data Modeling](https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-modeling)**

- **A conceptual data model** consists of **highly abstract levels of data elements called entities and relationships** between entities. It presents a high-level overview of the database system through a visual representation of the entities it contains and their relationships to one another. The conceptual model provides the basis for the logical data model.
- **A logical data model** builds on the conceptual model by **providing a more detailed overview of the entities in their respective relationships**. It identifies the attributes of each entity, defines the primary keys, and specifies the foreign keys. The logical data model serves as an intermediary between the high-level conceptual model and the physical implementation. It describes how the data will be organized in the database and provides a blueprint for building the physical database.
- **A physical data model** is used to create the **schema** of the database, which is then implemented in the database management system. The physical data model defines the structure of the database, including the data types, constraints, and attributes. It specifies how the data will be stored in the specific database management system being used.

In conclusion, a **conceptual data model** is a high-level view of the database that is used to communicate with stakeholders about the requirements of the database. The **conceptual data model** can then be used to create a **logical data model**, which is a more detailed view of the database that includes the relationships between entities, and the constraints and rules that apply to the data. Finally, the **logical data model** can be used to create **a physical data model**, which is the actual database schema that is implemented in a database management system.

## Data Warehouse Model (OLTP vs OLAP)

Understanding the difference between OLTP and OLAP models is crucial for effective data warehouse design.

## From Logical Data Model to Physical Data Model

The transition from a Logical Data Model (LDM) to a Physical Data Model (PDM) is a critical step in database implementation.

Physical Table Structure Should Include:

- **Technical metadata** (job_id, insert/update data, etc)
- **Technical columns** for managing the data quality
- **Primary and/or secondary indexes** of the table to improve performance
- **Table partitioning functions**
- Adding **surrogate key** to simplify join, improve performance, optimize space
