summary: 'This article examines various hierarchy types in data modeling, including Fixed Depth Positional Hierarchies, Slightly Ragged Hierarchies, and Ragged Hierarchies. Fixed Depth Hierarchies feature clear many-to-one relationships, such as product to brand, allowing for easy navigation and quick queries. The article discusses strategies for managing ragged hierarchies through the use of bridge tables and pathstring attributes to simplify analysis and improve performance.'

Hierarchical structures in dimensional modeling can be classified into three main types: balanced, unbalanced, and ragged hierarchies. Each type presents unique characteristics and implementation considerations that directly impact query performance and system design.

## Balanced Hierarchies

**Balanced hierarchies** represent the most common hierarchical structure, characterized by a consistent number of levels across all branches. Every path from the root to leaf nodes traverses the same number of hierarchical tiers.

_Example: Calendar hierarchy (Year → Quarter → Month → Date) or standardized geographic hierarchy (Country → State → City)_

The levels in balanced hierarchies are typically derived from columns within a single denormalized dimension table or from tables forming a snowflake dimension structure. When higher-level columns exist within a denormalized dimension, they contain redundant data that facilitates rapid query execution.

- Fixed number of levels across all branches
- Facts typically relate to the lowest hierarchical level
- Supports aggregation from detailed to summary levels
- Can be represented as distinct positional attributes within dimension tables

## Unbalanced Hierarchies

**Unbalanced hierarchies** feature varying depths across different branches, with levels determined by parent-child relationships rather than predefined column structures. The hierarchical depth depends on dimension row relationships rather than static table schema design.

_Example: Employee reporting structure where organizational depth varies by department_

In unbalanced hierarchies, dimension tables utilize surrogate keys alongside foreign key references to the same table, creating self-referential relationships. Facts apply to the dimension grain, requiring careful consideration of individual records and their hierarchical descendants during aggregation.

- Variable number of levels determined by data relationships
- Parent-child relationships define structure
- Each member can potentially have subordinates
- Requires recursive queries or specialized handling

## Ragged Hierarchies

**Ragged hierarchies** occur when members exist at levels that are not directly adjacent to their logical parents, creating gaps in the hierarchical structure. Missing intermediate levels are typically handled by repeating parent values or using null placeholders.

_Example: Geographic hierarchy where some countries lack state/province subdivisions (e.g., New Zealand: Country → City, bypassing state level)_

Ragged hierarchies present significant challenges for traditional relational database queries, often requiring specialized modeling techniques such as bridge tables or pathstring attributes to maintain query efficiency and structural integrity.

- Inconsistent intermediate levels
- Parent-child relationships may skip hierarchical tiers
- Requires special handling for missing levels
- Complex aggregation and navigation requirements

### Fixed Depth Positional Hierarchies

When hierarchical depth remains constant and level names are standardized, these structures should be represented as distinct positional attributes within dimension tables. This approach provides optimal query performance and intuitive navigation patterns.

### Slightly Ragged Hierarchies

For hierarchies with limited depth variation, **slightly ragged structures** can be adapted into **fixed depth positional frameworks** by creating dimension attributes for maximum level counts and populating them according to established business logic.

### Variable Depth Hierarchies

Irregular hierarchies with undefined depth present significant modeling challenges requiring specialized approaches:

#### Bridge Table Approach

**Bridge tables** contain rows for every possible hierarchical path, enabling standard SQL traversal without specialized language extensions.

| ParentID | ChildID | HierarchyLevel | Distance | TopFlag | BottomFlag |
| -------- | ------- | -------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| NULL     | 1       | 1              | 0        | Y       | N          |
| 1        | 2       | 2              | 1        | N       | N          |
| 1        | 3       | 3              | 2        | N       | Y          |
| 2        | 3       | 3              | 1        | N       | Y          |

#### Pathstring Attribute Approach

**Pathstring attributes** store complete hierarchical paths as encoded text strings, enabling efficient navigation without bridge table complexity.

| NodeID | NodeName      | PathString                  | Level |
| ------ | ------------- | --------------------------- | ----- |
| 1      | World         | /World                      | 1     |
| 2      | North America | /World/North America        | 2     |
| 3      | USA           | /World/North America/USA    | 3     |
| 4      | Canada        | /World/North America/Canada | 3     |
