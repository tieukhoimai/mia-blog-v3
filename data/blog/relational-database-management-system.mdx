## 1. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

- An RDBMS is a database management system based on the relational model
    - A relational data model makes it possible to graphically represent the requirements and data organization of a company
- In general, the minimum requirements for which a system can be called an RDBMS are
    - Display data to the user in the form of relation
    - It must provide relational operators to manipulate data in tabular form
    - The universally known model for "designing" a database is the table

## 2. Core Functions of RDBMS

### 2.1. Data Management Operations

**Archiving, Deletion, and Data Review:**
- Information stored in the form of relations
- Depending on access rights, databases allow direct processing of stored information through SQL queries
- Data in databases can be completely deleted, with recovery options varying by implementation

### 2.2. Multi-user Access

In multi-user environments:
- Distribution of rights and data security are critical
- Systems must keep data consistent even when multiple transactions are requested simultaneously
- Concurrent access control prevents data conflicts

### 2.3. Data Integrity

**What is Data Integrity?**
The data within a database contains specific rules, ensuring the correctness of the data and defining the logic of the business process that the database is intended to model.

**How is it Maintained?**
- Prevent multiple users from editing the same record simultaneously (record locking)
- Prevent duplicate records from being entered
- Enforce business rules and constraints

### 2.4. Data Security

Data security involves:
- Preventing illegitimate access to stored data
- Management by responsible administrators
- Implementation of appropriate cryptographic methods
- Technical precautions to prevent unwanted manipulation or loss of data

### 2.5. Metadata Management

- Information is usually stored in databases by creating tables
- Metadata is information that describes a set of data
- Metadata can also be queried and managed like regular data

## 3. ACID Properties - Database Transaction Requirements

ACID represents the fundamental features and requirements for database management systems:


### 3.1. Atomicity

**Definition:** Denotes the *all-or-nothing* property of the DBMS.

- Only valid requests are executed in the established order
- Ensures that the entire transaction is correct
- A transaction is either completely executed or not executed at all
- Guarantees transaction completeness and correctness

### 3.2. Consistency

**Definition:** Requires that successful transactions leave a stable database.

- If a transaction completes successfully, it should be recorded in the database
- All integrity rules and constraints must be maintained
- Database remains in a valid state before and after transactions

### 3.3. Isolation

**Definition:** Transactions do not obstruct each other.

- Guaranteed by specific blocking functions
- When multiple transactions occur simultaneously, each executes independently
- Prevents interference between concurrent transactions
- Maintains transaction independence

### 3.4. Durability

**Definition:** All data is stored permanently in the DBMS.

- Data persistence even after successful transaction completion
- Valid especially in case of system errors or DBMS failures
- Ensures data will not be lost during system failures or crashes
- Once committed, data is reliably written to the database

## 4. Relations in Relational Databases

### 4.1. Definition of Relation

A relation is a set of tuples, where each element $d_j$ is a member of domain $D_j$.

**Example:**

| CustomerID | CustomerName | Status |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Google | Active |
| 2 | Amazon | Active |
| 3 | Apple | Inactive |

**Domain Examples:**
- For CustomerID: domain $D_1$ could be the set of positive integer numbers
- For CustomerName: domain $D_2$ could consist of all strings (text values)
- For Status: domain $D_3$ could be a predefined list of valid statuses (Active, Inactive)

### 4.2. Functional Dependency

**Definition:** Attribute B of relation R is functionally dependent on attribute A of R if, at every instant of time, each value in A has no more than one value in B associated with it under R.

![Functional Dependency](/static/images/resource/relational-database-management-system/functional-dependency.png)

**Notation:**
- $R.A \rightarrow R.B$: if $R.B$ is functionally dependent on attribute $A$ in $R$
- $R.A \neq R.B$: if $R.B$ is NOT functionally dependent on attribute $A$ in $R$
- If $R.A \rightarrow R.B$ and $R.B \rightarrow R.A$ then $R.A$ and $R.B$ are in one-to-one correspondence: $R.A \iff R.B$

The definition given above can be extended to **collections of attributes**: If $D,E$ are distinct collections of attributes of $R$, then $E$ is functionally dependent on $D$ if at every instant of time, each $D$-value has no more than one $E$-value associated with it under $R$.

## 5. Database Modeling and Normalization

A database is a tool for grouping and managing information of various kinds through the use of tables, in which the data is related to each other

**Problems with Single Table Approach:**
- Risk of data redundancy
- Does not highlight relationships between data subsets in a timely manner
- Duplicated and redundant information

**Solution - Normalization:**
- A **gradual process** of progressive optimization
- Starts from non-normalized relations
- Reaches a certain level of normalization
- Eliminates redundancy effectively

## 6. Primary Key Concepts

### 6.1. Primary Key Definition

A set of one or more attributes can be defined as a primary key if it has the following characteristics:

- **Unique Identification**: The set uniquely defines a record
- **Non-redundancy**: Removing any attribute from the set (key) causes loss of uniqueness

### 6.2. Choosing a Primary Key

**Best Practices:**
- Keys composed of fewer attributes are preferable
- For efficiency reasons, prefer keys with attributes frequently used in relational operations
- Ensure stability - primary key values should not change frequently

## 7. Foreign Key Relationships

### 7.1. Foreign Key Definition

A **foreign key** is a column (or set of columns) in one table that connects to the primary key data in another table.

**Key Terminology:**
- **Parent Table**: The reference table containing the primary key
- **Child Table**: The table containing the foreign key
- **Relationship**: The foreign key in the child table references the primary key in the parent table

### 8.2. Foreign Key Benefits

- Establishes and enforces links between tables
- Maintains data consistency across related tables
- Prevents orphaned records
- Supports referential integrity

## 9. Referential Integrity

### 9.1. Definition and Importance

**Referential Integrity** is a property of a database in which all values of all foreign keys are valid.

### 9.2. Referential Constraints

A **referential constraint** is the rule by which, given a child table, the values of the foreign key are valid only if:
- They appear as values of a parent key
- Null values are usually allowed (depending on business rules)

## 12. Conclusion

Relational Database Management Systems form the backbone of modern data management, providing robust, reliable, and scalable solutions for storing and managing structured data. Understanding the principles of RDBMS - from ACID properties to referential integrity - is crucial for anyone working with data.

The concepts covered in this article, including relations, functional dependencies, primary and foreign keys, and referential integrity, are fundamental to designing efficient and reliable database systems. As data continues to grow in importance across all industries, mastering these RDBMS concepts becomes increasingly valuable.
