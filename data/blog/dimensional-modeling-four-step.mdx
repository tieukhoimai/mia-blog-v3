summary: 'This article outlines a structured approach to Data Design, detailing essential steps for creating effective data models that align with business needs. It covers gathering business requirements, conducting collaborative workshops, and following the Four-Step Dimensional Design Process. The article also features a use case for modeling data in a Fast Food outlet and discusses managing changes in dimension data using Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs).'

## Step 1: Select the Business Process

Consider the needs of the business along with the realities of the underlying source data during the collaborative modeling sessions.

- **Business processes** are the **operational activities performed by an organization**, such as taking an order, processing an insurance claim, registering students for a class, or snapshotting every account each month.
- **Business process events** generate or capture metrics that translate into facts. Most fact tables focus on the results of a single business process.
- **The process** is important because **it** defines a specific design target and allows the grain, dimensions, and facts to be declared.
- **Each business process** corresponds to **a row** in the enterprise data warehouse bus matrix.

Following the **`business process`, `grain`, `dimension`, and `fact declarations`**, the design team determines the table and column names, sample domain values, and business rules.

## Step 2: Declare the Grain

- The grain establishes exactly what a single fact table row represents
- The grain declaration becomes a binding contract on the design
- The grain must be declared before choosing dimensions or facts because every candidate dimension or fact must be consistent with the grain
- This consistency enforces a uniformity on all dimensional designs that is critical to BI application performance and ease of use
- **`Atomic grain`** refers to the lowest level at which data is captured by a given business process
- We strongly encourage you to start by focusing on atomic grained data because it withstands the assault of unpredictable user queries

## Step 3: Identify the Dimensions

**Dimensions for Descriptive Context:** Dimensions provide the "who, what, where, when, why, and how" context surrounding a business process event.

In Kimball dimensional modeling, the "**7Ws**" refers to a structured approach to identifying business processes and events, focusing on "who, what, when, where, why, how, and what else" to build a data warehouse model, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the business.

### The 7Ws Process

- **Who**: Identifies the actors or entities involved in the business process
- **What**: Describes the events or actions that occur
- **When**: Specifies the timing or timeframes of the events
- **Where**: Indicates the location or context of the events
- **Why**: Explains the motivations or reasons behind the events
- **How**: Describes the methods or processes used to execute the events
- **What Else**: Encourages exploration of additional relevant details and context

### BEAM Method

The 7Ws approach is often used in conjunction with the BEAM method:

- **B**usiness **E**vent
- **A**ttribute
- **M**easure

BEAM helps in identifying event stories by asking "who does what" questions and then expressing the answer as a simple story, like "traders buy commodities".

The BEAM method uses tools like hierarchy charts, timelines, event matrices, and enhanced star schemas to model events, dimensions, processes, and star schemas.

**Benefits of the 7Ws Approach:**

- Helps in identifying key business processes and events
- Facilitates the creation of a more accurate and business-oriented data warehouse model
- Enables better data analysis and reporting

Dimension tables contain the **descriptive attributes** used by BI applications for filtering and grouping the facts. Dimension tables are the drivers of the user's BI experience.

## Step 4: Identify the Facts

- Facts are the **measurements** that result from a business process event
- A single fact table row has a one-to-one relationship to a **measurement event** as described by the fact table's grain
- **A Fact table** corresponds to **a physical observable event**, and not to the demands of a particular report
- **Only facts consistent with the declared grain** are allowed
