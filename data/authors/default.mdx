I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at the University of Verona. With over 3 years of experience as a Data Analyst, I held a dual role at Fossil Group as an Analytics Project Manager and Data Analyst. Additionally, I specialize in designing intricate data flow mechanisms between connected devices and companion apps. Leveraging my expertise, I ensure seamless and efficient data transfer, providing valuable insights into user behavior, product performance, customer segmentation, and wellness data from wrist-based wearable devices.
