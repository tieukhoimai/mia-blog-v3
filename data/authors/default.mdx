I am currently a second-year Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Verona, Italy. Through the Erasmus program, I spent a transformative semester at the University of Oslo. Since April 2025, I have been working as a research intern with the Trustworthy Green IoT Group at SINTEF Digital in Norway.

My journey into data science began with four years in analytics engineering in Vietnam. Recently, at Fossil Group, I served as Analytics Project Manager, leading cross-functional teams to architect lightweight data warehouses and design data modeling solutions for mobile and wearable devices. These experiences strengthened my expertise in data infrastructure, end-to-end analytics workflows, and agile collaboration, and revealed how data can drive meaningful change. Since 2023, my academic pursuits have focused on data-centric topics—databases, data mining, and data visualization—which fuel my passion for intelligent data systems and interactive data exploration, especially those leveraging semantic representations and knowledge graphs.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I am deeply committed to knowledge sharing through various initiatives documented on this website. Since 2023, I have created and presented [educational content on data visualization](https://www.dtacracy.org/recap-talk-6-data-visualization-storytelling/) for Vietnamese university students and early-career professionals as part of the DATAcracy Program—a U.S. Department of State-funded initiative empowering the next generation of data scientists in Vietnam. In 2024, I developed a Vietnamese writing assistant powered by [retrieval-augmented generation](https://tieukhoimai.me/series/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag), exploring how LLM-based systems can provide natural, context-aware writing support for low-resource languages. This project reflects my broader mission to make intelligent technologies accessible across linguistic and cultural boundaries. Since early 2025, I have been contributing as a data scientist to the [MapMe Project](https://mapme.asia/), a community-driven initiative that integrates satellite time-series data, infrastructure maps, and census statistics to build geospatial tools for the Mekong Delta. Collaborating with environmental science and spatial data experts, I help develop knowledge-driven mapping solutions that support sustainable development and climate resilience in the region.
