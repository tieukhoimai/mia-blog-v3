I am currently a second-year Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Verona, Italy. Through the Erasmus program, I spent a transformative semester at the University of Oslo. Since April 2025, I have been working as a research intern with the Trustworthy Green IoT Group at SINTEF Digital in Norway.

Beyond my professional work, I’m passionate about sharing knowledge through the initiatives featured here. Since 2023, I’ve presented [data visualization workshops](https://www.dtacracy.org/recap-talk-6-data-visualization-storytelling/) for Vietnamese students and early-career professionals through the U.S. State Department-funded DATAcracy Program, built a [Vietnamese writing assistant](https://tieukhoimai.me/series/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) using retrieval-augmented generation to bring LLM-based tools to low-resource languages, and, since 2025, contributed as a data scientist to the [MapMe Project](https://mapme.asia/), a community-driven initiative where I help create geospatial tools supporting sustainable development and climate resilience in the Mekong Delta.
